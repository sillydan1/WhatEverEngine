# WhatEverEngine
This is an attempt to make a game engine using C# and OpenGL and Python as a scripting language. This is done completely in my freetime, so don't expect alot of updates, but please share it if you like it. (I'm using giawa's OpenGl library for mostly everything graphics: https://github.com/giawa/opengl4csharp )
